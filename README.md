# Malaria_in_Africa_Jornalism124_Final_Report
This repository is mainly through the dataset that report about the malaria in Africa to analysis about the relationship between the malaria cases with the local environment condition.
## Story Pitch
### Background
Malaria has long been one of the most deadly diseases on the African continent. With approximately 95% of malaria cases in Africa each year and a subsequent death rate of up to 96%, there has never been a way to control malaria. Until 2015, a Chinese Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine Youyou Tu found artemisinin, a derivative of anthocyanin that is the fastest-acting drug against Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria is a disease that can go from infection to death very quickly, so prevention malaria and timely follow-up therapyare especially important. This malaria of Africa table includes the number of reported infections in each country in Africa from 2007 to 2017, also includes about people who have safely managed drinking water services or sanitation and other informations. By analysis this table can determine whether the invention of penicillin was effective in controlling malaria for African countries.

## Data Analysis

### Note：No additional data cleaning is required for the table's data

#### Q1:From 2007 to 2017, which are the countries with the highest malaria case report each year?

First I download the data to Excel, since I want to find out the each years' highest report, I select each years's malaria case report column，and sort by a descending order. I also highlighted the highest report case for each year and the country's name.

From these charts we conclude that there is an overall upward trend in the number of people with malaria each year, with the exception of 2007 and 2008, congo,Dem,Republican has been the most reported country for malaria, with nearly nine times more people getting malaria in the country from 2009 to 2017. 2016 was the year with the highest number of malaria cases in congo,Dem,Republican with 16,821,130 cases.

#### Q2:By using the Choropleth map show the malaria severity of countries in africa.

In this question I want to use data visulization to intuitively observe the extent to which each country in Africa is affected by malaria.

I use datawrapper to create a choropleth map, first I need to select my map, in this case I chose Africa. Then, I upload my data for visulization,by selecting the colunm of the incidence of malaria, the map automatically generated. In anotate, I clicked the map label botton for show up countries name, I also did the continouse type to make the infection region more clear.

The map shows that the southwest and central regions are at the highest risk of malaria, with the highest proportion of malaria. The northern and southern parts of Africa have very little chance of contracting malaria, and Egypt has a near zero risk. a black and purple section next to the Democrtic republic of the congo is Rwanda, which has a near maximum chance of contracting 550.

#### Q3: Find out the average Incidence of malaria in all Africa countries in 2013 and 2017.

In this quetsion, I select 2013 and 2017 as comparison is becasue the artemisinin
