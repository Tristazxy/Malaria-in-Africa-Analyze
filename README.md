## Story Pitch
### Background
Malaria has long been one of the most deadly diseases on the African continent. With approximately 95% of malaria cases in Africa each year and a subsequent death rate of up to 96%, there has never been a way to control malaria. Until 2015, a Chinese Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine Youyou Tu found artemisinin, a derivative of anthocyanin that is the fastest-acting drug against Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria is a disease that can go from infection to death very quickly, so prevention malaria and timely follow-up therapyare especially important. This malaria of Africa table includes the number of reported infections in each country in Africa from 2007 to 2017, also includes about people who have safely managed drinking water services or sanitation and other informations. By analysis this table can determine whether the invention of penicillin was effective in controlling malaria for African countries.

First I download the data to Excel, since I want to find out the each years' highest report, I select each years's malaria case report column，and sort by a descending order. I also highlighted the highest report case for each year and the country's name.
